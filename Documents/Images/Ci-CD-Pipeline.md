# The Auto Deploy:

### The application is powered by a CircleCl-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline script.

---

# How The Auto Deploy Work:

- Once a commit has been successfully published to the repository's master/main branch, the pipeline starts.

- CircleCI runs the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) script after detecting the changes in the repository's master/main branch.

- The updates will be deployed to AWS once the app has successfully completed the build and deploy script's steps.
