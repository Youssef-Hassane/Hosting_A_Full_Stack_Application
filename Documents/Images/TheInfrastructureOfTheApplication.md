# The Infrastructure Of The Application

This is a web application that is provided by Udacity so that students can utilize it to finish the third project. This application is utilizing both Ionic and Angular as the FrontEnd, Express as Server, and Postgres as Database. I'm utilizing Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (AWS EB) in order to host the BackEnd, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) in order to host the FrontEnd, and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) as the Database.
